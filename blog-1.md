The Significance of Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript-->



TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, offers a robust type system that empowers developers to write more reliable and maintainable code. Among its many features, union and intersection types are particularly powerful tools for modeling complex data structures and relationships.

Union Type--

A union type represents a value that can be one of several types. It's declared using the pipe (|) symbol.

Example : 

type combine = string | number;

In this example, the Combine type can be either a string or a number.Like this example typescript union types is working.

Intersection Type--

An intersection type combines multiple types into a single type that includes all properties of the constituent types.
It's declared using the ampersand (&) symbol.

Example : 

type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

type Colorful = {
  color: string;
};

type ColorfulPerson = Person & Colorful;

Here, the ColorfulPerson type combines the properties of Person and Colorful, resulting in a type with name, age, and color properties.

This two type is important in typescript because.It makes more flexibility, precision, readability, type safety etc.
By effectively utilizing union and intersection types, TypeScript developers can write more robust, maintainable, and expressive code.
